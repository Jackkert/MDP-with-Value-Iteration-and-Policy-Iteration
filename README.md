# MDP with Value Iteration and Policy Iteration
Solving MDP is a first step towards Deep Reinforcement Learning. This notebook will show you how to implement **Value Iteration** and **Policy Iteration** to solve some OPENAI GYM environments.

The only dependencies are:
- gymnasium 0.29.1
- numpy 
- time
